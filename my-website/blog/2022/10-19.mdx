I was trying to separate the example code of put and post requests that are written together on Bluetron official site while translating.

<!--truncate-->

The difference between put and post is as follows:
- PUT: Same requests sending repeatedly, previous request will be replaced.
- POST: Same requests sending repeatedly, previous request will not be replaced.
That leads to:
- PUT is normally used to update resources.
- POST is more used to create resources.<br/>

In CRUD
- POST: Create resources on the server.
- PUT: Update resources on the server.
- DELETE: Delete resources from the server.
- GET: Read resources from the server.
