## Background Information
Today I wanted to start my bolg again to write down something that I have picked up during daily work and life which might come in handy in the future.

<!--truncate-->

## Actions Taken
1. In docusaurus.config.js file, uncomment **{to: '/blog', label: 'Blog', position: 'left'}** to display **Blog** on the navigation bar.
2. Changed blog status from **false** to original.
```
 blog: {
          showReadingTime: true,
        }, 
```
3. Save the changes and run the site locally.
## Error and Attemps
- Error: Multiple modules related to blog/default cannot be be found.
- Attempts:
    - Inspect the difference between my site and other sites which can display blog tab normally.
    - Copy and paste the entire blog folder under **.docusaurus**.
## Solution
Restart the local debugging service by pressing ctrl + c in terminal and then run **npm start** again.
:::tip
You can also try the command `docusaurus clear [siteDir]` to clear all generated assets, caches, build artifacts on your site.
