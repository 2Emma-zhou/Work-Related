It happened this morning, around 6:30. No alarm, my daughter somehow woke up.<br/>
She was groping for her book which she brought to the bed with her last night. She does that every night.<br/>
But no luck.<br/>
And suddenly she bursted into tears, loudly. I was shocked and patted her father awake to get her book.<br/>
The book was not carefully taken care of last night after she fell asleep, it was wrinkled but that did not seem to be a problem for her at the moment.<br/>
Few seconds later, she started to wail harder than before because she realized that the front and back page of her book was falling off after she tried to flip a few pages in the dark.<br/>
I had to sit up at this moment to turn on the light due to her non-stop crying sound of "turn..on..on..on..".<br/>
I turned on the night lamp, but she was not content, going on with the cry, loud enough to drive all my remaining drowsiness away.<br/>
I checked her book, and it occured to me that I could use a stapler to stick them together.<br/>
I asked her father: "Do you want to be your daughter's hero?"<br/>
Well, he went happily.<br/>
I comforted her, told her that I could fix the book, she had to wait for her father to get the stapler.<br/>
So she went quiet for a few moments.<br/>
Got the stapler, I stapled the book and strengthened its ridge before I gave it back to her.<br/>
She opened a page and felt the difference.<br/>
The book was stitched together vertically down the ridge, but the stapler could only go horizontally, so when she opened a page, she saw that the page was not flat but had a little curve near the ridge.<br/>
Again a louder wave of weeping, along with leg-kicking, hands-waving and frantic body-swirling.<br/>
I thought about the fact that she was turning into this phase where she starts to feel a lot of emotions and realizes things around her, and she may have learned that she could get things going the way she 
wants if she cries hard enough during being watched by her grandparents.<br/><br/>
So I couldn't just give her what she wanted, not that I could anyway. I needed to let her know that things can always go some other ways than we expected, but we were allowed to have feelings and express them, in a right way.<br/>
So I asked her:"Can I hug you?"<br/>
She opened her arms and sat on my lap, weeping.<br/>
I held her in my arms, and said:"You feel angry and upset because the book is not the same as before right?"<br/>
"Mama knows that you are upset, but Mama can only fix the book this way."<br/>
Then I took the book and held it before her face:<br/>
"See? It was stitched together, but Mama only has a stapler. I can only staple it together."<br/>
"But the content is still the same. You can still read it, flip it and all. You just have to pat it or smooth its ridge when you open a page."<br/>
"Yeah, like this. Smooth here." Her Dad joined.<br/>
She calmed down a little.<br/>
Okay, another tide of wailing.<br/>
Guess she wasn't happy about the smoothing ridge solution.<br/>
It was over 7 by then, I had like 10 minutes before I had to get up and get ready for work.<br/>
So I told her repeatedly that the page needed to be pressed flat and I could do that by putting it under several books, repeatedly.<br/>
And I had to give her another book for exchange.<br/>
She accepted, watched me puttiing her book on the night stand and stacking books on top.<br/>
She became happier and turned to flipping other books and fully woke up and routine went on.<br/>
Anyway, this morning I experienced sudden mood swings when she was doing that "I am very angry" crying set, repeatedly. <br/>
I also went cold face on her, I told her if she wanted to keep this unreasonable crying going on, she could do it at the corner, not on my bed.<br/>
But generally, I managed to calmed myself down, not to be at the same level of upsetness as her or even higher. I comforted her, I let her know that I felt her mood and feelings.<br/>
It's okay to express your feelings, Mama got your feelings and tried to help you, so you let Mama help and give Mama time.<br/>
I told her we both love her even though she woke us up this early and cried like a little chipmunk who has been robbed off all her belongings. Of course the "even though" part was said inside my head.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this thing lets me know that my daughter is slowly but evidently growing up. She is experiencing a lot of emotions that she might just ignored before, and now she tries to express them.<br/>
It's a good thing. <br/>
What I need to do is to accept and embrace her feelings.<br/>
They may come a little fierce, they may come at bad times, they may even defeat me and make me a bad Mama (let's hope that never happens).<br/>
But I will keep reminding myself that I can never let her temper take the lead, I cannot be as angry as her, otherwise who would lead her out and guide her to the right way of feeling expression.<br/>
<br/>
Last thing, I love my daughter no matter what she does.<br/>
