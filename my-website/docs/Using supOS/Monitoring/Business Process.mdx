        In design center, you can use different elements to form a diagram to
        demonstrate the full process. The diagram changes based on equipment
        running status in real time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The process diagram in below figure contains multiple graphic elements,
        connections, video elements and data connection elements with dynamic
        effects configured.
      </p>

:::info

Dynamic effects allow you to
        directly view equipment status through graphic element colors, flashing status and fluid volume.
