# Factory Modeling

## Introduction <a href="#0-toc-title" id="0-toc-title"></a>

Through the object model management provided by the supOS platform, the digital modeling of production units such as workshops, staff, equipment, products and materials in the factory is realized.

* Create models based on the features of equipment in the factory, to manage and apply the business information such as attributes, operating status, maintenance records and fault records.
* The object models describe the job responsibilities of different roles in the factory, and features of various materials.

## Object Model <a href="#1-toc-title" id="1-toc-title"></a>

A complete object model contains an object template, an object instance and a function set, representing the corresponding product type, specific product and product functions respectively. For each model, you need to configure the following parameters.

* **Basic Information**: Describes the model name, aliases, parent templates, function sets, and details.

Object aliases must be unique under one name space (APP or system).

* **Attributes**: Describes attributes of object instances.
* **Attribute Info**: Displays the current status of an object instance, such as device name, device number, temperature, pressure and speed.
* **Alarm** **rules**: Defines rules of alarm events. When the collected data is updated, the supOS platform judges whether to trigger an alarm based on the rules.
* **Services**: Functions that you can use instance properties to realize.
    * You can define one or more services for each object instance.
    * Services can be used by other features on the platform.
* **Events**: Messages sent by object instances and subscribed by external parties.
    * An event is triggered when the data source changes or the configured logic applies.
    * A subscriber who listens to the event should be created during modeling.
    * A data set containing the event-triggering field must be linked with the event.
:::info
Field names in the data set must be the same as aliases of the instance properties.
:::
* **Subscriptions**: Receives and responses to events.
    * Uses data set linked with the event to define reactions based on business logic.
    * The same event can be subscribed by multiple subscribers.

### Object Template Creation <a href="#3-toc-title" id="3-toc-title"></a>

Object templates integrate basic and common features of a type of object instances. A sub object template and an object instance inherit all information from their parent template. When the parent template changes, the object instance and the sub template changes too.

* You can create hierarchical object templates by analyzing the commonality of similar equipment and staff, thereby improving modeling efficiency.
* Object templates can derive one or more additional features through function sets. Therefore, modeling can be maintained easily and quickly.

:::info
* You can search for, copy, edit, import, export and delete custom object templates. Fuzzy match is available.
* Embedded templates can only be copied.
* Inherited templates can only be deleted after you cancel inheritance, and the deletion cannot be undone.
:::

#### Embedded Template <a href="#4-toc-title" id="4-toc-title"></a>

* **Entity Template**: Object templates that match with the entities in the factory, such as workers, workshops, equipment, products and materials.
    * **Collector Template**: Automatically inherited by collectors connected to the supOS platform.
    * **Link Template**: Automatically inherited by the third party data connected to the supOS platform.
    * **Video Template**: Automatically inherited by real-time video sources connected to collectors.
    * **History Video Template**: Automatically inherited by history video sources connected to collectors.
    * **AE Collector Template**:
* **Form Template**: You can manually create a form structure of relational data under the form template. Each property is a column header, and each object instance is a row of data.
* **Relation** **Template**: Builds the relations between object models.

    For example, associate the attribute **company name** under the company template with the attribute **staff name** under the staff template to build an employment relation template. Subsequently, you can filter the corresponding staff by company name.

:::info
**Foreign Relation Template** is generated by default.

Click **Binding** **Relationship** on the **Attributes** page, drag attributes from the right side to the left to bind them.

:::info

* The higher the **Compression Parameters**, the heavier the data is compressed.
* **Maximum Upload Cycle** defines the maximum interval between 2 time points when the corresponding data will still be recorded no matter how high the **Compression Parameters** is.

:::

2. Click the **Alarm rules** tab, and then click **New**.
3. Set the rules, dead zone and priority of the alarm, select whether to enable it and then click **OK**.

* Set alarm rules based on data type of the property. For example, set **Condition** to **>** and **Limit** to 90, meaning an alarm will be triggered when the property value is higher than 90.
* **Dead Zone Type** can be percentage or value. **Dead Zone** **Value** is used to filter false alarms. For example, set **Dead Zone** **Type** to **Value** and **Dead Zone** **Value** to **10**, when the property value is higher than 90, an alarm goes off, and then the alarm will only be cancelled when the property value goes back to below 80, which means **Limit** – **Dead Zone** **Value** (90 – 10) = 80.

1. Click the **Script** tab, you can directly enter a JS script or click **Object Selector** to select objects from existing properties, services and events of other templates or instances.

The supOS platform converts data groups in JS script to JSON and then to MAP on the back-end. When JS data groups are included in parameters or results, you can either convert them to strings or use **Java.type(“java.util.ArrayList”)** to convert.

1. Click **OK**.
2. Click **Events**, and then click **New**.

* Make sure you have created data sets, containing fields that trigger events. For details, see [Creating Data Set](https://www.freezonex.io/docs/supos-factory-modeling-software/#dataSet).
* Make sure the event-triggering field name is the same as the instance property alias.

| Statistics Configuration | Only available when calculating instant value.<br />Select **Calculation** **Begin**, the first instant value calculated in each cycle is returned; select **Calculation** **End**, the last instant value calculated in each cycle is returned.|
| Instantaneous Time       | Only available when calculating instant value. Changes return time of results to the exact time.<br />For example, an instant value is returned at 12:31:09, select **Instantaneous Time**, and then the result is returned at 12:31:09 instead of the begin time of a calculate cycle. |
| Max. Time/Min. Time      | Only available when calculating maximum or minimum value. Select it to change the return time of results to the exact time.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Back to 0 Rule           | Enable it, and the platform returns difference after restore the value to original. For example, the value on a meter goes to 0, and a difference will be returned after the meter value is restored to original. Otherwise, the difference will be negative.                                             |
