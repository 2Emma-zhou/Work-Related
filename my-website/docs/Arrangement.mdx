Since it's actually my website, so it's fair to say that I have certain rights of writing something that I really want to record.
My daughter went to day care again today. I was gonna drop out actually since the moment I saw her there when I went picking her picking her up.
She saw me, she cried and reached out. I grabbed her into my arms, and I could feel how much she was scared, scared of the hypothesis that her mom, dad and grandparents might leave her there forever.
She held on to my neck so tight that I couldm't stand putting her down on the ground. She immediately started waving goodbye to her teacher.
I lingered there for a minute to chat, trying to get more details of her day.
I was mature, I said that it was all normal, it was her first day, I should give her the credit and blah blah blah.
I took her to the car, she was smiling.
When we went to pick up her father in the metro station.
I parked near a bus stop, and I was trying to read the stop sign but couldn't. I got off and assured her that I was only out to read a sign and I would be back very soon.
But when I got back, I found that she was crying again with tear filled in her eyes.
I knew then she was still in such a concern that I might leave her with a fake assurance.
I told this to my husband, he immediately said that we should drop out.
But his parents, who take the main responsibility when it comes to taking care of my daughter in a large portion of a day, insisted that she should keep going and it would all be fine.
Sure.
I know it will all be fine. Things are fine after 11 years since my mother's death.
I just don't want her to feel all that scare, helplessness.
She went again today, of course. I mean, I need to be stronger right?
I just wish she would feel a lot better very soon.
